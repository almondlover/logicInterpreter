wpf app that supports defining, solving and generating logical functions. The logical expressions presented in a function's body are defined as tree graphs. All defined functions are saved to a file. Functions' values can be calculated after passing  their operands' values.
There's also a dedicated button for generating the full truth table of a function. Passing a full or partial truth table can return the (first) function that matches it if any exists.
A function's corresponding graph can be visualized.
